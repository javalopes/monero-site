  private_text: "Monero uses hidden amounts, origins and destinations of @transactions. This means that nobody knows how much you're sending in a transaction except you. This ensures that your purchases and other transfers remain private by default."
  untraceable_text: "By taking advantage of @ring-signatures, Monero allows you to send and receive funds privately. Even though your transactions are publicly verifiable on the @blockchain, transactions use digital signatures that specify a group of signers such that the person verifying canâ€™t tell which person actually produced the signature. Because it's ambiguous which funds have been spent, your transaction remains private and cannot be traced back to you."
  secure_text: "Monero uses a distributed peer-to-peer @consensus network and every transaction is cryptographically signed. Your coins are safely stored on the @blockchain and can be restored at any time with the use of a 25 word @mnemonic-seed on any computer with the Monero software. Wallet files are encrypted on disk and locked with a passphrase, rendering them useless if stolen."
